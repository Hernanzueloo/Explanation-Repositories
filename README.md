# Explanation-Repositories

My public repositories are categorized as follows, they are arranged chronologically (the higher the number the newer the project):

1-AAlg (Algorithm Analysis): This repository focuses on various sorting and searching algorithms. It includes calculations of the average operation and time cost for each method, ranging from linear and binary search algorithms to sorting algorithms such as Insert Sort, Quick Sort, or Heap Sort. The main objective of this project is to conduct various experiments and prepare reports analyzing different algorithms.

2-FFBB (Miniature Database): This repository contains different projects regarding the management, indexation and storation of data. Each of them explores a differente aspect of database creation.

3-ANTHILL (Game): This project, developed by a team of four, aims to enhance cooperation and coordination among programmers. It focuses on organizing and thoroughly testing each module within the project while promoting proper documentation practices.

4-SOPER (Block-Chain Simulation): In this project, we simulated a Block-Chain network using Linux semaphores, signals, queues, and threads to synchronize all the miners and optimize. It is divided in 4 different stages: 3 independent projects and a fourth one that combines all of them.
