# Explanation-Repositories

My public repositories are categorized as follows, they are arranged chronologically:

1-AALG (Algorithm Analysis): This repository focuses on various sorting and searching algorithms. It includes calculations of the average operation and time cost for each method, ranging from linear and binary search algorithms to sorting algorithms such as Insert Sort, Quick Sort, or Heap Sort. The main objective of this project is to conduct various experiments and prepare report analyzing different algorithms.

2-FFBB-Practicas (Miniature Database): This repository consists of a C-based miniature database comprising an index file, a data file, and all the necessary functions to manage the database. It serves as an introduction to the underlying software used in real databases. During the development of this project, we also gained extensive knowledge of SQL.

3-ANTHLL (Game): This project, developed by a team of four, aims to enhance cooperation and coordination among programmers. It focuses on organizing and thoroughly testing each module within the project while promoting proper documentation practices.

4-SOPITA-_DE_SOBRE (Synchronized Block-Change Simulation): This repository involves different mining processes that compete with each other to obtain coins by performing calculations using a Proof of Work function. The code emphasizes a solid understanding of concurrency and synchronization among processes, utilizing Linux semaphores, signals, queues, and threads to improve mining performance in each process. It is divided in 4 different stages: 3 independent projects and a fourth one that combines all of them.

Although university policy primarily dictated the use of C and Python for these projects, we have also acquired a strong understanding of C++, as well as other languages such as SQL and MATLAB through different exercises and tests.
